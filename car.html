    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>This is my 1989 BMW 325i Coupe. I purchased this vehicle years ago and I am its 3rd owner. <br>
        For a 34 year old car its in great condition. It is rear wheel drive and has a naturally aspirated 2.5L Inline Six engine with 178hp</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I have always loved the boxy styling of the E30 and wanted to own one. I looked online for many months until found this one for sale. <br>
        It was is great condition and reasonably priced for now days. These days E30s are skyrocketing in value, especially the M3.<br> 
        They go for upwards of anywhere from 40K to 100K. Regardless all E30 models are getting more valuable even the ones in very bad shape.</p>
